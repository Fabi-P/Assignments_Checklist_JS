<h1 align="center">Assignments checklist</h1>


This is a single page web application created to support students in completing all the requirements for a set of assessments.
Through a minimalistic layout that shows details only on hover, students can focus on one assignment at a time, ensuring to have hit all the targets.
Once a task (o requirement) has been completed (or implemented), the checkbox can be ticked to keep track of the work done.

### What the app does

- Create and delete new assignments
- Add specific tasks and implementation notes for each assignments
- Use a checkbox to keep track of tasks implemented
- Delete tasks
- Empty local storage (this will delete all the saved assignments and related tasks)


### Features

- The app has been created using vanilla **JavaScript, HTML and CSS**
- The assignments and tasks are saved on the client browser's local storage
- The design is minimalistic to avoid distractions
- Each assignment's tasks are showed on hover to keep the layout clean and help students maintain focus


### Word of WARNING

Once assignments have been completed, it is good practice to use the <kbd>Free Local Storage</kbd> button in order to clear the browser's memory and avoid it slowing down.


### Potential future improvements

- Improvements in the design
- Saving to local file
- Mobile app development
